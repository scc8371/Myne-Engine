# MYNE ENGINE<br>
# PROJECT FOR SUMMER 2022.<br>
Uses OpenGL to render. Will be used for many upcoming projects<br>.

<em>Please note, this is the first engine I've ever written, and there are bound to be flaws. This project is mainly used to demonstrate what I've learned regarding the development of game engines.</em><br>


# Important Documentation <br>
<hr>
Please include these to allow the engine to work, after properly placing the Myne dlls into your project.<br>
#include "Myne/src/App.h"<br>
#include "Myne/src/Game.h"<br><br>

<b>Please note, these includes are likely to be changed at a later date.</b><br>

<em>App.h</em>: Contains most of the engine's initialization. Sets up OpenGL, OpenAL, freetype, physics, and various managers.<br>
<em>Game.h</em>: A template class that holds overridable functions that make up a basic initialization and game loop.<br><br>
