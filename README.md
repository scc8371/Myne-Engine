# MYNE ENGINE<br>
# PROJECT FOR SUMMER 2022.<br>
Uses OpenGL to render, OpenAL for sound, and freetype for typography.<br>

<em>Please note, this is the first engine I've ever written, and there are bound to be flaws. This project is mainly used to demonstrate what I've learned regarding the development of game engines.</em><br>
